# The Hidden Lattice Problem

This repository contains the source code for the algorithms described in the article 'The Hidden Lattice Problem' by Luca Notarnicola and Gabor Wiese.
The implementation is in SageMath 9.2.

The file hlp.sage contains the corresponding functions, on which the practical experiments are based.
